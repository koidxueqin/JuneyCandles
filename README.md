## Description

Scented candles have been increasing in popularity for personal use, gifts, or home decoration. Many consumers are looking for unique and personalised options, with various fragrances and designs that match their moods, spaces, and personal interests. 

However, consumers have limited avenues to fully customise their products and struggle to discover fragrances and designs that suit them the most. 

Existing platforms offer some degree of customization but often fall short in terms of flexibility and personalization, especially in incorporating various types of themes that express creativity.
